Tile Editor

Steps to use the Tile Editor


Creating a map

Once the application has been opened, you can select a tile and place it anywhere on the grid.

There are three strengths that can be assigned to each tile. None, Normal and Block. The 'None' strength can be used for creating a background, 'Normal' strength can be used for normal blocks, 'Block' strength can be used for unbreakable blocks. 

You can also import a tile from a **.png** image. Please select the image from the pop-up window and it will be imported into the Tiles/ folder for future use as well.

A new map can be generated on clicking the new map button and confirming the selection on the dialog box.


Saving your map

Once you have completed creating your map, you can Save the map using the buttons given below. The map will be saved as two files, a **.gmap** file and a **.gmap.props**file.


Loading your map

You can also Load a map that has already been created. For this to work, you need to select the *.gmap file from the first pop-up window, and the *.gmap.props file from the second pop-up-window. Then the map will be generated onto the grid.
